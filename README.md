## Why we are pursuing what we are pursuing
As forest fires continue to ravage the environments of many, and the tides seek to claim what was once our land. 
HuSCII CO2 seeks to inform those of the adverse effects of carbon emissions. 
While they have been on the decline for the past few years, the team feels that the pace we are reducing the emissions is not enough.
Let's compare where we are and where we should be!

## What is our impact / significance
dWith this project the team hopes to inform and invite solutions to the overall conversation that carbon emissions is posing currently.
More importantly, reaching the goal ofo net 0 must be achieved first, before we think about becoming fully sustainable. 
Change is slow, but with your help, this just gives us time to better direct our course!
